<p>I love the internet. </p>
<p>Specifically, I love how it enables me to discover and explore new ideas and cultures around the world. </p>
<p>Online video, and in a large part YouTube, is a strong interest of mine. It has been my window to new cultures, and I enjoy learning about people that are completely different from me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also 100% certain that I share this interest with others around the world; for them, I make videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAgC9zvQ5NjKtg0Py3AnxJA">YouTube channel</a> (and have a lot of fun doing so :) </p>
<p>When I&#39;m not watching/filming/editing videos, I work for a web3 protocol. Here, I pursue my long-standing interest in blockchain applications.</p>
<p>I&#39;m always down for a quick chat, so feel free to reach out to me if you wanna talk web3, videos or anything else. (Could be your favourite book / meme / podcast / concept / etc.——I promise I won&#39;t judge!) </p>
